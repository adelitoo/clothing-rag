3.  **Confidence First**: If you are not confident, do not include the filter.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Always respond with ONLY valid JSON containing a "filters" key.
2.  If no specific attributes can be extracted, return: {{{{"filters": {{}}}}}}
3.  Use exact values from the valid mappings above. Your `FashionSearchExecutor` is already configured to handle the list for `index_name`.

For the query "{query}", respond ONLY with a valid JSON object.
